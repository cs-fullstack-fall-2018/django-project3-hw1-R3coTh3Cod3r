# django_project3_hw1

How much work do you have left on your project? Describe it below:
Currently I'm a bit unsure at the moment I have all my paths working except one and I have to figure out how to import the information from my admin site to my actual web page. Overall progression is moving steady but feel a bit slow. I feel that I am only 40% - 55% done at best.
